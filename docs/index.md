## Key Features

*   **Action Sequencing**: Create and run sequences of keyboard presses and mouse actions.

*   **Theme Support**: Toggle between Light (Flatly) and Dark (Darkly) themes.
*   **Advanced Mouse Control**: Perform clicks and movements at specific screen coordinates (`moveto(x,y)`, `click(x,y)`).
*   **Coordinate/Color Capture**: Easily capture mouse coordinates (X,Y) and screen pixel color (R,G,B) with a single click.
*   **Color Detection**: Pause execution until a specific color appears at designated coordinates (`waitcolor`) with timeout error handling.

*   **Save/Load Configurations**: Save/Load sequences and run settings (repetition mode/count) to JSON files.
*   **Safety Features**: Toggleable Safe Mode and Emergency Stop (ESC key).
*   **Visual Feedback**: Highlights the current row, shows loop counts, and overall status.
