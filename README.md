## Features

-   üéÆ **Action Sequencing**: Create and run sequences of keyboard presses and mouse actions.
-   ‚è±Ô∏è **Customizable Timing**: Set delays *after* each action and specify hold durations for keys/mouse buttons.
-   üîÑ **Repetition Control**: Choose to run sequences **indefinitely** or for a **specific number of times**.
[//]: <> (-   üé® **Theme Support**: Toggle between **Light** (Flatly) and **Dark** (Darkly) themes via the Options menu.)
-   üñ±Ô∏è **Advanced Mouse Control**: Perform clicks and movements at specific screen coordinates (`moveto(x,y)`, `click(x,y)`, etc.).
-   üéØ **Coordinate/Color Capture**: Built-in tool to capture mouse coordinates (X,Y) and screen pixel color (R,G,B) with a single click.
-   üé® **Color Detection**: Pause script execution until a specific color appears at designated coordinates (`waitcolor`).
    -   Includes **robust error handling**: Pauses automation and shows a clear error message if the color isn't found within the timeout, preventing infinite loops.
-   ‚å®Ô∏è **Reliable Typing**: Type strings accurately, preserving case and handling symbols (`Hello World!`, `user@example.com`, etc.).
-   üíæ **Save/Load Configurations**: Save your sequences and run settings (repetition mode/count) to JSON files and load them back anytime via the File menu.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Safety Features**:
    -   **Safe Mode** (toggleable via Options menu) prevents potentially disruptive keys/commands.
    -   **Emergency Stop** (ESC key) immediately halts execution.
-   üí° **Visual Feedback**:
    -   The currently executing row is highlighted.
    -   Row status indicators show progress (‚ñ∫ running, ‚úì completed).
    -   Status bar displays overall state (Stopped, Running, Loop Count, Completed, Emergency Stop).
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **UI Organization**:
    -   Tabbed iterface support, with each sequence per tab
    -   Clean interface with primary controls (Start/Stop) readily available.
    -   File operations, Options (Safe Mode, Theme), and Help are neatly organized in a **top menu bar**.
    -   Action rows feature intuitive controls for **moving up/down**, **duplicating**, and **removing**.
-   ‚å®Ô∏è **Global Hotkeys**: Start (`Ctrl+F2`), Stop (`Ctrl+F3`), and Emergency Stop (`ESC`) from anywhere (requires admin/root privileges on some systems).
-   ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info Panel**: Detailed, formatted help window explaining all possible keys and commands (accessible from the Help menu).


## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2.  **Clone the repository** (Optional, if you have the code directly, skip this):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleKeyClicker.git
    cd SimpleKeyClicker
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Quick Start

1.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    1.1.    CLI arguments can be specified to open single or multiple JSON configs - f2.json, f3.json, etc. (extensions will be added automatically):
    ```bash
    python main.py f2 f3 f4
    ```
2.  Click "**Add Row**" to create steps for your sequence.
3.  For each row:
    *   Enter a **Key/Button** or command (see Help > Show Keys/Actions Info).
    *   Use "**Capture**" to easily get coordinates/colors for commands like `moveto`, `click(x,y)`, `waitcolor`.
    *   Set the **Hold Time** (how long a key/button is held down, 0.0 for a simple press/click).
    *   Set the **Delay** (pause *after* the action completes).
    *   Jump to support:
        * **Jump to**: editbox allows to jump to a defined row at a step. Works only if `jumpcount` > 0.
        * **Jumcount**: editbox specifies count of jump repetitions.
        * `Jump to` and `Jumpcount` can be used only once per automation, i.e. don't specify these parameteres more than for only one row in a sequence.
        > [!CAUTION]
        > Using `Jump to` and `Jumpcount` can cause your automation to infinite loop. It is not recommended to use these functions, only in case of extreme need.
4.  Use the **‚ñ≤**, **‚ñº**, **‚ùè**, **X** buttons on each row to organize your sequence.
5.  Select the desired **Run Mode**: "Run Indefinitely" or "Run X Times" (enter the number of repetitions).
6.  **(Optional)** Go to **File > Save Configuration** to store your setup.
7.  Click "**Start**" or press `Ctrl+F2` to begin automation.
8.  Click "**Stop**" or press `Ctrl+F3` (or `ESC`) to halt automation.

## Available Actions (Key/Button Field)

*(Refer to **Help > Show Keys/Actions Info** in the app for detailed, formatted explanations)*

**Basic Keyboard Input:**
*   Single letters (`a`, `b`), digits (`1`, `2`), symbols (`!`, `@`, `,`). Handled by `pyautogui.write` for reliability.
*   Special keys: `tab`, `space`, `enter`, `esc`, `backspace`, `delete`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `f1`...`f12`, etc. Handled by `pydirectinput.press`.
*   Modifier Keys (use `Hold Time > 0`): `shift`, `ctrl`, `alt`, `win` (Windows key). Handled by `pydirectinput.keyDown`/`keyUp`.
*   Any unrecognized text is typed out using `pyautogui.write` (e.g., `Hello World!`).
*   `+`, `-` are now excluded from recognised symbols.

**Basic Mouse Input (Current Cursor Position):**
*   `click` (Left click)
*   `rclick` (Right click)
*   `mclick` (Middle click)
    *(Use `Hold Time > 0` to hold the click)*

**Advanced Mouse Input (Specific Coordinates):**
*   `moveto(x,y)`: Moves the mouse cursor to screen coordinates (X, Y).
*   `click(x,y)`: Moves to (X, Y) and performs a left click.
*   `rclick(x,y)`: Moves to (X, Y) and performs a right click.
*   `mclick(x,y)`: Moves to (X, Y) and performs a middle click.
    *(Use `Hold Time > 0` with these to hold the click at the specified position)*

**Keydown & Keyup input**
*   `+`: modifier before singlekey command modifies behaviour to fire keydown event, i.e: `+ctrl` will fire ctrl keydown event. Must be freed with any row firing keyup event (see next).
*   `-`: modifier before singlekey command modifies behaviour to fike keyup event, i.e.: `-ctrl` will release ctrl key, after fired before keydown event.
> [!WARNING]
> Every single `+` keydown event must be completed with `-` release event, i.e. `+crtl`, ... do something ..., `-ctrl`, ....


**Color Detection:**
*   `waitcolor(r,g,b,x,y)`: Pauses execution until the color (R, G, B) is detected at screen coordinates (X, Y).
    *   **Behavior**: If the color is not found within the timeout (~30 seconds), a **modal error dialog** appears, pausing the script. Automation **stops** after you click "OK" on the dialog.

**Reset Mouse Position:**
*   `resetmouse`: restores mouse position as it was on the moment of starting key automation.

## Safety Features

### Safe Mode
*   Enabled by default (toggle via **Options > Safe Mode** in the menu).
*   Blocks potentially disruptive keys (`alt`, `ctrl`, `shift`, `win`, `f4`, `delete`, `tab`) and commands (`waitcolor`).
*   Provides an extra layer of safety, especially when testing new sequences.

### Emergency Stop
*   Pressing the `ESC` key at any time will immediately halt the automation sequence.
*   The application status will update, and a confirmation dialog will appear.

### Global Hotkeys
*   `Ctrl+F2`: Start the automation sequence - default hotkey.
*   `anyhotkey`: hotkey will be specified as opened JSON config filename, can be one of `f1-f6, up, down`. Don't use wrong filenames!
*   `Ctrl+F3`: Stop the automation sequence gracefully.
*   `ESC`: Emergency stop (immediate halt).
    *(Note: May require administrator/root privileges to register)*

## Tips and Best Practices

1.  **Test Thoroughly**: Always test new or complex sequences, preferably with **Safe Mode** enabled initially.
2.  **Use 'Capture'**: The `Capture` button is the easiest way to get accurate coordinates and colors for commands.
3.  **Understand `waitcolor`**: Be aware that it will *stop* the script if the color isn't found within the timeout. Ensure the target color/coordinates are correct.
4.  **Appropriate Delays**: Add sufficient `Delay` between actions, especially those that rely on UI changes or animations to complete.
5.  **Save Often**: Use **File > Save Configuration** to back up your automation configurations.
6.  **Start Simple**: Build complex sequences incrementally.
